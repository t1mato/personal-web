Resume Setup Instructions
========================

To enable the resume download functionality:

1. Place your resume PDF file in this directory (/public)
2. Name it: resume.pdf
3. The download button in the Hero section will automatically work

Note: The public folder is served at the root level, so /public/resume.pdf
becomes accessible at https://yourdomain.com/resume.pdf

Best Practices:
- Keep file size under 2MB for fast downloads
- Use a professional filename when downloaded (currently: Timothy-Lee-Resume.pdf)
- Update your resume regularly to reflect latest experience
- Consider adding a "Last Updated" date to your resume
